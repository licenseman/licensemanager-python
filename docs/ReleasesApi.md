[**delete_release**](ReleasesApi.md#delete_release) | **DELETE** /v1/releases/{id} | Delete a release

# **create_release**
> Release create_release(product_id, create_release)

Create a release

Releases don't restrict which versions `validateKey` accepts: a machine can run a version without a release. They give the `latestAllowedVersion` of its `version_not_allowed` errors, among the stable releases already released, and the number of active machines running each version.

**Required role permission**: `release:create` when called with a session, granted by the member's role. API keys aren't limited by roles.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (apiKey):

```python
import licensemanager
from licensemanager.models.create_release import CreateRelease
from licensemanager.models.release import Release
from licensemanager.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.licensemanager.dev
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = licensemanager.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.licensemanager.dev"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: apiKey
configuration.api_key['apiKey'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['apiKey'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with licensemanager.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = licensemanager.ReleasesApi(api_client)
    product_id = 'x7Kp2QaZ' # str | 
    create_release = licensemanager.CreateRelease() # CreateRelease | 

    try:
        # Create a release
        api_response = api_instance.create_release(product_id, create_release)
        print("The response of ReleasesApi->create_release:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling ReleasesApi->create_release: %s\n" % e)

# **list_releases**
> ReleaseList list_releases(product_id, page=page, page_size=page_size, sort=sort, search=search, released_from=released_from, released_to=released_to, active_machine_count=active_machine_count, active_machine_count_min=active_machine_count_min, active_machine_count_max=active_machine_count_max)

List the releases of a product

Sorting by `version` compares the major, minor and patch numbers as numbers, then puts a pre-release before its stable release. Pre-releases of the same version compare as text, unlike semantic versioning: `2.0.0-beta.10` comes before `2.0.0-beta.2`. Build metadata is ignored.
